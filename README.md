## About

A simple Express-based application to search, view and save Tweets. Used for the @GuyApologetic account, a Twitter
experiment. This is a work in progress. I apologize if you don't find this useful. 

"Why?", asked no one. 

Just horse_ing around for now. ;P 


12th Jan 2107: Connect to Twitter. Search Twitter for a string. View results. Save selected tweets to mongodb. View saved tweets.
